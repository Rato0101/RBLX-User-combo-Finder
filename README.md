# RBLX-User-Combo-Finder

This program allows you to retrieve bulk information about Roblox users from combo or text (TXT) files.
For combo files containing user:pass pairs, the program does not process or verify passwordsâ€”it simply copies them to the output TXT file as-is.

The program provides the following user information:

    Username

    User ID

    Join date (formatted as dd/mm/yyyy)

If a combo file with user:pass pairs is provided, these pairs will be included at the end of the output file.
The program automatically filters out emails and usernames that are not found.

This project was created with passion (and maybe a bit of GPT) by ProtoThundercloud on Discord!
