# RBLX-User-Combo-Finder

This program allows you to retrieve bulk information about Roblox users from combo or text (TXT) files.
For combo files containing user:pass pairs, the program does not process or verify passwords—it simply copies them to the output TXT file as-is.


If a combo file with user:pass pairs is provided, these pairs will be included at the end of the output file.

This project was created with passion (and maybe a bit of GPT) by CloudKernelFox on Discord!
